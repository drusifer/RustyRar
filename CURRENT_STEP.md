# Current Step: Fix Failing Tests

This document outlines the plan for fixing the failing tests in `tests/archive_tests.rs`.

## 1. Current Status: Blocked

The `test_read_file_data` test is consistently failing with a `failed to fill whole buffer` error. This indicates a fundamental issue in how the mock archive data is being constructed for the test.

## 2. Summary of Attempts

*   **Initial Analysis:** The error pointed to a problem with the `header_size` calculation in the `Block::encode` method.
*   **Attempt 1 (Incorrect Encoding Logic):** Multiple attempts were made to correct the `Block::encode` method by adjusting how `header_size` was calculated. These changes introduced other regressions or failed to solve the core issue.
*   **Attempt 2 (Unit Test Isolation):** A round-trip test (`encoder_tests.rs`) was created to isolate the encoding/decoding logic. This test passed, proving that the `FileHeader` struct can be successfully serialized and deserialized in isolation.
*   **Attempt 3 (Revisiting Integration):** Applying the lessons from the successful unit test back to the integration test `test_read_file_data` has not resolved the failure.

## 3. Roadblock

I have been unable to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure within the `test_read_file_data` test setup. My reasoning about the interaction between the `Archive` reader and the encoded block data is flawed, but I cannot identify the mistake.

**Assistance is required to move forward.** A fresh perspective on the `test_read_file_data` test in `tests/archive_tests.rs` and the `Block::encode` method in `src/structures/block.rs` is needed.
